            <p>
                We are the small, but enthusiastic Future Business Leaders of America chapter of North
                Brunswick High School! Every year we compete with other chapters around the country 
                in a variety of competitions and if one does a very good job through regional and state 
                competitions they get the prestigious chance to compete in the National Leadership Conference
                for scholarships and recognition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through fundraisers and events around our school and local town of Leland, we raise money 
                to get the chance to travel and attend all of our conferences and competitions. Not only 
                does the money help us arrive to these conferences, they help cover our travel, hotel, food,
                and other necessities.
            </p>

            <p>
                North Brunswick High is settled on the southern east coast of the country and our National
                Leadership Conference is over 2000 miles away! We need to purchase airplanes tickets for 
                all of our competing members to get a chance to actually compete and earn a scholarship!

            <h2 class="pagetitle"> Scholarships </h2>         
            <p>
                Fortunately our small chapter in the south east of North Carolina is able to raise money
                by ourselves to dedicate to scholarships and increase the amount of scholarship money.
                We create events and fundraisers for our school and town for this cause, though donors 
                are encouraged to help our competitors get decent scholarships for their business futures.

            <h2 class="pagetitle"> Reservations </h2>
            <p>
                Unlike North Carolina, California is an expensive state. We plan
                to stay for the conference for at least 7 days, we will need to reserve places to eat for our large
                party, hotel rooms, plane tickets, and any other events that we will need to be at together.

            <h2 class="pagetitle"> Hotel </h2>
            <p>
                Along with our transportation needs we need a cozy place to stay upon arrival. Thus, money
                donated gives us the chance to get a safe and comfortable place to stay for the days we stay
                for the conference.
